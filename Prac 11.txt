Consider the given relational table:  
 Employee(Emp_No,Emp_Name,Designation,City,Salary,Zipcode,County) 
1. Creates a sequence used to generate employee numbers for the empno column of 
the emp table. 
2. Create an Index on county. 
3. Find the zip code whose county = 071 and check whether the query uses the Index and 
write your observation. 
4. Create a view for employees having salary <50000 and stays in 'Mumbai'


Below are the SQL queries to fulfill each of your requirements:

### 1. Create a sequence to generate employee numbers for the `Emp_No` column in the `Employee` table.

To create a sequence for the `Emp_No` column, we can use the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement. This sequence will automatically generate unique employee numbers for new records.

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE Emp_No_Seq
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1
NOCACHE;
```

- This will start the sequence from 1 and increment it by 1 for every new employee record.

### 2. Create an Index on the `County` column.

To create an index on the `County` column of the `Employee` table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_county ON Employee(County);
```

- This index will help speed up queries that filter by `County`.

### 3. Find the zip code whose county = 071 and check whether the query uses the index.

First, let’s query the `Employee` table to find the zip code where the county is '071'. We can then observe if the index on `County` is being used by checking the execution plan.

```sql
SELECT Zipcode
FROM Employee
WHERE County = '071';
```

To check whether the index is being used, you can use the `EXPLAIN PLAN` statement (specific to Oracle or databases that support it):

```sql
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT Zipcode
FROM Employee
WHERE County = '071';
```

- After running the `EXPLAIN PLAN` statement, you can check the query plan to see if the `idx_county` index is being used. If the index is being used, you should see something indicating the use of the `idx_county` index.

### 4. Create a view for employees having a salary < 50000 and staying in 'Mumbai'.

A view allows you to store a SQL query and access it like a table. Here’s how you can create a view for employees with a salary less than 50,000 who stay in Mumbai.

```sql
CREATE VIEW Mumbai_Low_Salary_Employees AS
SELECT Emp_No, Emp_Name, Designation, City, Salary, Zipcode, County
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < 50000 AND City = 'Mumbai';
```

- This view filters employees based on salary and city, and it can be queried like a table. For example, you can retrieve all employees in the view with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Mumbai_Low_Salary_Employees;
```
