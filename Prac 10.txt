Consider the given database schema: 
Student(Student_Id,Student_Name,Instructor_Id,Student_City) 
Instructor(Instructor_Id,Instructor_Name,Instructor_City,Specialization)  
1. Find the instructor of each student.  
2. Find the student who is not having any instructor.  
3. Find the student who is not having any instructor as well as instructor who is not 
having student.  
4. Find the students whose instructor’s specialization is computer.  
5. Create a view containing total number of students whose instructor belongs to “Pune”.



### 1. Find the instructor of each student.
```sql
SELECT s.Student_Id, s.Student_Name, i.Instructor_Name
FROM Student s
JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id;
```

### 2. Find the student who is not having any instructor.
```sql
SELECT s.Student_Id, s.Student_Name
FROM Student s
LEFT JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id
WHERE s.Instructor_Id IS NULL;
```

### 3. Find the student who is not having any instructor as well as instructor who is not having any student.
```sql
-- Students without instructors
SELECT s.Student_Id, s.Student_Name
FROM Student s
LEFT JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id
WHERE s.Instructor_Id IS NULL;

-- Instructors without students
SELECT i.Instructor_Id, i.Instructor_Name
FROM Instructor i
LEFT JOIN Student s ON i.Instructor_Id = s.Instructor_Id
WHERE s.Student_Id IS NULL;
```

### 4. Find the students whose instructor’s specialization is computer.
```sql
SELECT s.Student_Id, s.Student_Name
FROM Student s
JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id
WHERE i.Specialization = 'Computer';
```

### 5. Create a view containing the total number of students whose instructor belongs to “Pune”.
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentsFromPune AS
SELECT COUNT(s.Student_Id) AS Total_Students
FROM Student s
JOIN Instructor i ON s.Instructor_Id = i.Instructor_Id
WHERE i.Instructor_City = 'Pune';
```
