Consider the given Database Schema: 
 employee (employee-name, street, city) 
 works (employee-name, company-name, salary) 
 company (company-name, city) 
 manages (employee-name, manager-name) 
 Find the names of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation. 
 Find the names, street addresses, and cities of residence of all employees 
 who work for First Bank Corporation and earn more than $10,000. 
 Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities and on the 
 same streets as do their managers. 
 Find all employees in the database who earn more than each employee of Small 
Bank Corporation. 
 Find all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of 
their company. 
 Find the company that has the smallest payroll.



Here are SQL queries based on the schema provided:

### 1. Find the names of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation:
```sql
SELECT employee-name
FROM works
WHERE company-name = 'First Bank Corporation';
```

### 2. Find the names, street addresses, and cities of residence of all employees who work for First Bank Corporation and earn more than $10,000:
```sql
SELECT e.employee-name, e.street, e.city
FROM employee e
JOIN works w ON e.employee-name = w.employee-name
WHERE w.company-name = 'First Bank Corporation' AND w.salary > 10000;
```

### 3. Find all employees in the database who live in the same cities and on the same streets as their managers:
```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM employee e
JOIN manages m ON e.employee-name = m.employee-name
JOIN employee manager ON m.manager-name = manager.employee-name
WHERE e.street = manager.street AND e.city = manager.city;
```

### 4. Find all employees in the database who earn more than each employee of Small Bank Corporation:
```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM works e
WHERE e.salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary
    FROM works
    WHERE company-name = 'Small Bank Corporation'
);
```

### 5. Find all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees of their company:
```sql
SELECT e.employee-name
FROM works e
WHERE e.salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM works
    WHERE company-name = e.company-name
);
```

### 6. Find the company that has the smallest payroll:
```sql
SELECT company-name
FROM works
GROUP BY company-name
ORDER BY SUM(salary) ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

### For reference, here are the SQL `INSERT` statements to populate sample data into the tables:

```sql
-- Insert data into employee table
INSERT INTO employee (employee-name, street, city) VALUES
('John Doe', '123 Elm St', 'New York'),
('Jane Smith', '456 Oak St', 'Los Angeles'),
('James Brown', '789 Pine St', 'Chicago');

-- Insert data into works table
INSERT INTO works (employee-name, company-name, salary) VALUES
('John Doe', 'First Bank Corporation', 15000),
('Jane Smith', 'First Bank Corporation', 12000),
('James Brown', 'Small Bank Corporation', 8000);

-- Insert data into company table
INSERT INTO company (company-name, city) VALUES
('First Bank Corporation', 'New York'),
('Small Bank Corporation', 'Los Angeles');

-- Insert data into manages table
INSERT INTO manages (employee-name, manager-name) VALUES
('John Doe', 'Jane Smith'),
('Jane Smith', 'James Brown');
